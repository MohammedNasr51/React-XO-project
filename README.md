# React XO Project

## Overview
The React XO Project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game (XO) built using React. This project demonstrates fundamental React concepts such as state management, component-based architecture, and user interactions. It is a great starting point for understanding how React can be used to create interactive web applications.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Two players can take turns playing the game on a 3x3 grid.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The game state updates in real-time as players make their moves.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically checks and announces the winner or a draw.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable layout for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React
- **Styling**: CSS
